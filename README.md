# Kreate
Unleash your creativity with this new drawing app for Kindle.
You will finally be able to sketch in your device and design your own masterpieces.

See the `examples` page to see what has been done.
If you draw something you are proud of and would like me to share it, let me known and I will add it to the folder ðŸ˜Š


# Challenges
One huge challenge when it comes to programming a drawing app in Kindle is that the `kindle.gestures` object is able to detect only taps and at best the general direction of swipes (that is: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`) but not the exact directions or ending point.
This means that it is impossible to draw by simply dragging your finger on the screen.

To make up for this Iâ€™ve set up several drawing modes, where it is possible to decide what you want to draw (a dot, a line or a curve -*yes curves too*)

Iâ€™ve programmed it in a way that it should adapt to any screen, regardless of model or size, but if you have any problem with the sizing please let me know and I'll see what I can do.


## Installation
1.  **PREREQUISITES:** Your Kindle must be **jailbroken** with the **Universal Hotfix** and **Winterbreak** installed. 
2.  Insert the folder `/kreate` in the `/documents` folder on your Kindle's main storage partition (from root it would be: `/mnt/us/documents`)
3.  That's it. Now you can run it from the homepage.

## Future Implementations
* Add an icon
* Generally improve usability and make it less clumsy
* Button to download your *horro* ahem ahem **masterpieces**
* Generator of the drawing's QR code
* `Geometric Shapes` mode (circles, rectangles, triangles, etc)
* `Fill Color` mode
* dot size indicator
* `Back` Button
* Better UI (use more images instead of words)
* Improve top bar (making it show the current mode and color)
